# API-Requests
In this project I gathered data from a JSON API and used it to build an app directory for a fictional start-up company. The app will display basic contact information for 12 employee's. The contact information includes a picture, name, email and city and state for each employee. When the user clicks on a specific employee, a moduel will appear displaying more information about the employee such as birthday, address and phone number.
